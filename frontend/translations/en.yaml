  title: MSS Submission Form

  instructions-html: |
    <p>Mass Submission System (MSS) is the service for submitting relatively large nucleotide sequence data (not reads) by sending text files. We at DDBJ recommend using MSS when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Submission is not applicable for Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/est-e.html">EST</a>, STS, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/tsa-e.html">TSA</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/htc-e.html">HTC</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/gss-e.html">GSS</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/htg-e.html">HTG</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/wgs-e.html">WGS</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/con-e.html">CON</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/tls-e.html">TLS</a></li>
          <li>See <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/documents/data-categories-e.html#division">Categories for Sequence Data</a> in detail.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Submission with sequences length greater than 500 kb.
      </li>

      <li>
        Submission file with more than, approximately, 30 features.
      </li>

      <li>
        Submission consists of more than 500 sequences. If the number of sequences is greater than 1000, you have to submit two or more times via NSSS.
      </li>
    </ul>

      </p>

      <p>You can apply for the submission or upload the submission files when the submission matches the following requirements. Otherwise, you must aggregate the submissions until requirements are achieved.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>same contact person</li>
        <li>same submission data type</li>
        <li>same publication date</li>
      </ul>

    q-1: Select one that matches the submission type.

    a1-1: Yes, I have determined the nucleotide sequence by my study.
    a1-2: No, I have created the nucleotide sequences by assembling from the publicly available data.

    q-2: If you would like to submit TPA to MSS, a paper which describes information about the assembly, should be finally published on a peer-reviewed journal. Select one from the items below.

    a2-1: I will submit (or have already submitted) a paper to a peer-reviewed journal.
    a2-2: No, I have no plan to submit a paper.

    about-tpa-url: https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/tpa-e.html
    about-tpa:     TPA

    unacceptable: Regarding TPA, you cannot apply to MSS unless you will prepare a paper.

    a1: I would like to upload the Bacterial complete genome or WGS submission files that have been prepared by DFAST.
    a2: I would like to upload the submission files that have been prepared without using DFAST.
    a3: I will prepare submission file after the application.
