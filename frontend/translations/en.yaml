      <p>You can <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/mss.html#submission" target="_blank">apply as one submission</a> when the submission matches the all requirements below. Otherwise, you must separate the submission files so that each submission becomes to match the requirements, and apply each submission separately. See <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/mss-e.html#submission-1" target="_blank">"Example case where you must apply for the registration more than two times"</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>same contact person</li>
        <li>same submission data type</li>
        <li>same publication date</li>
      </ul>

    q-1: Select one that matches the submission type.

    a1-1: Yes, I have determined the nucleotide sequence by my study.
    a1-2: No, I have created the nucleotide sequences by assembling from the publicly available data.

    q-2: If you would like to submit TPA to MSS, a paper which describes information about the assembly, should be finally published on a peer-reviewed journal. Select one from the items below.

    a2-1: I will submit (or have already submitted) a paper to a peer-reviewed journal.
    a2-2: No, I have no plan to submit a paper.

      In the case where you upload the submission files, be sure to check the format and/or translation of CDS feature by <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/ume-e.html" target="_blank">UME (Parser, transChecker)</a> and fix the errors. Finally, transfer the submission files having no errors. In order to specify the hold date, you <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/file-format-e.html#date" target="_blank">need to describe the hold_date in COMMON of the annotation file</a>. You cannot specify the hold date by the input area in the form.</p>
