  title: MSS Submission Form

  description-html: |
    <p>Mass Submission System (MSS) is the service to accept relatively large scale nucleotide sequence data (not reads) through sending text files. We at DDBJ recommend using MSS when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        the submission is not applicable for Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/est-e.html">EST</a>, STS, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/tsa-e.html">TSA</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/htc-e.html">HTC</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/gss-e.html">GSS</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/htg-e.html">HTG</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/wgs-e.html">WGS</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/con-e.html">CON</a>, <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/tls-e.html">TLS</a></li>
          <li>See <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/documents/data-categories-e.html#division">Categories for Sequence Data</a> in detail.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        the submission with long sequences.

        <ul>
          <li>greater than 500 kb in its length</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        the complex submission containing many features

        <ul>
          <li>more than 30 features</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        the submission consists of large number of sequences.

        <ul>
          <li>greater than 500, when number of sequences is greater than 1000, you have to submit two or more times via NSSS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

        Acceptable nucleotide sequences<br />

      </p>

      <p>You can apply for the submission or upload the submission files when the submission matches the following requirements.You must separate into some submissions and apply for MSS with each submission when the submission does not match any of the following requirements.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>same contact person</li>
        <li>same submission data type</li>
        <li>same publication date</li>
      </ul>

    q-1: Select one that matches to the submission.

    a1-1: Yes, I have determined the nucleotide sequence by my study.
    a1-2: No, I have created the nucleotide sequences by assembling from the publicly available data.

    q-2: A paper, which describes information about the assembly, should be finally published from a peer-reviewed journal, if you would like to submit TPA to MSS. Select one from the items below.

    a2-1: I will submit (or have submitted) a paper to peer-reviewed journal.
    a2-2: No, I have no plan to submit a paper.

    about-tpa:     About TPA

    unacceptable: Regarding TPA, you cannot apply to MSS unless you will prepare a paper.

      <p>You can upload the submission files that have been checked by <a href="https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/ume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UME (Parser and transChecker)</a>, if you already have. </p>

    a1: I would like to upload the Bacterial complete genome or WGS submission files that have been prepared by DFAST.
    a2: I would like to upload the submission files that have been prepared without using DFAST.
    a3: I will prepare submission file after the application.

      <p>Upload the annotation and nucleotide sequence file as a pair. Multiple pair files can be uploaded. The system determines as a pair whose filenames without the extension has the same name. The uploadable files are shown below. Do not upload the compressed files.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Annotation file</dt>
        <dd><code>.ann</code>, <code>.annt.tsv</code>, <code>.ann.txt</code></dd>
